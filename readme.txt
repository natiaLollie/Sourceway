SourceWay E-commerce needed a fresh new look for their online storefront. With a desire to create something bold, colorful, and youthful, I went to the drawing board chock-full of ideas to rebrand the startup. I updated the color palette, typography, logos, and branding materials. Thanks to the re-branding, the startup begin to attract thousands of unique repeat customers and consequently reached the 6-figure mark in under 3 years. Since then, I have also completed work coding and designing SourceWay's store template and social media graphics.
